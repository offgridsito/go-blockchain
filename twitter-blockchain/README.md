**TwitterChain**

With all the censorship going on in **Twitter**, **Instagram**, **Facebook**, this is one use case for blockchain. This blockchain aggregates Tweets from various user accounts, cross verifies by the network and posts them on distributed ledger.

If Twitter modified Tweets / deleted accounts people could reference the ledger to see what the "true" data was.


Run with
